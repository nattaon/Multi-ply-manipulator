multi-ply-manipulator
usage guide
1.voxel grid size = 0.02,
to filter every pointcloud to have a similar density.
2. rotate the pointcloud so that its height direction follows y axis(green).
3. rotate the room pointclound on xz axis, make it orgothonally.
(show rotation guide, to easy determine rotation number.)
4. get boundary -> show bounding (red), to check outlier points
5. adjust boundary range -> show bounding -> crop, 
to remove the outlier.
6. save ply
